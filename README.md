# Holidu Search Challenge

This challenge is based on a example project provided by play.
https://github.com/playframework/play-java-ebean-example

## Installation
- Install java
- Install sbt

## Usage
1. Change the directory to the project
2. Execute `sbt`
3. After the project is loaded execut `run`
4. Open `localhost:9000` in your browser

## Coding
Usually you don't have to stop and start the application while you are implementing the features.
Just safe the code and refresh the page in the browser.
But in case you experience some weird issues you should stop the application (CTRL+D) and execute `run` again.
NOTE: CTRL+C will also stop sbt and you need to execute `sbt` again and afterwards `run`.
